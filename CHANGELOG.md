# Changelog

All notable changes to this template will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Template parity upgrade to `agent-project-bootstrap` v0.11.1 (Cursor batch commands, design tokens, repo hygiene gates, release-please)
- CI jobs: repo-hygiene, feature-gate (web), upgrade-simulation, PR coverage comment
- Workflows: `weekly-health-check`, `release-please`, `scorecard`, `stale`, `dependabot-automerge`

### Changed

- `.template-version` bumped from `0.2.1` to `0.11.1`; `TEMPLATE_INDEX.json` pruned for web-only child repo
- `examples/web` synced with template Golden Path (About/settings modules, undici pin for jsdom)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- agent-project-bootstrap v0.2.1 scaffolding (Cursor rules, CI guardrails, workspace memory, scripts)
- Published PWA relocated to `site/` with GitHub Actions Pages deploy (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`)
- `site/` Playwright e2e + Lighthouse CI harness (`site-pwa` CI job)
- Repository ruleset **main branch protection** with required Security Scan, CodeQL, and CI checks
- ADR-0002 documenting `site/` vs `docs/` split and always-dark UI policy

### Changed

- `docs/` reserved for agent documentation; live site served from `site/`
- README merged with template sections (BUILD_PLAN labels, update checker, security triage)
- CodeQL limited to `javascript-typescript` (web-only stack)
- Service worker cache manifest aligned with actual assets (`matrix-cache-v3`)

### Removed

- Dead `.theme-toggle-btn` CSS (no theme toggle feature)
- Pruned python/android/lightroom stacks and related CI jobs

### Security

- Dependabot alerts and security updates enabled
- Private vulnerability reporting enabled
- Bootstrap 5.3.3 CDN loaded with SRI integrity hashes

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-13 (template upstream history)

### Added

- `scripts/check-workflow-action-ref-format.sh` — local pre-commit guard against bare-semver action refs
- `.github/workflows/health-check.yml` — weekly Monday 07:00 UTC poll of CI + Security Scan + CodeQL on main
- CI `android-build` job — `./gradlew assembleDebug` smoke for `examples/android/`
- Gradle wrapper binaries (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle-wrapper.jar`) in `examples/android/`
- `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` — six structured entries from v0.2.0 CI/security fix round
- `PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` entries 8–9 — workflow action validation and post-push GitHub gate
- Devcontainer `github-cli` feature; postStart runs encoding check + CI gate reminder
- README GitHub CI Gate section; init scripts run `validate-workflow-actions` and remind `check-github-ci`

### Changed

- Normalized root `.gitignore` from UTF-16 to UTF-8; added to encoding scan and pre-commit hook
- SHA-pinned `release.yml` actions: `anchore/sbom-action`, `softprops/action-gh-release`, `actions/attest-build-provenance`
- `docs/SECURITY_TRIAGE.md` — GitHub Actions pin policy, health-check in weekly triage table
- `modules/web/MODULE.md` — Lighthouse 3-run median policy documented
- `modules/android/MODULE.md` — CI assembleDebug documented; fixed corrupted path characters
- `docs/INITIALIZATION_PROMPT.md` — root `.gitignore` in encoding extension list
- `PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` entries 4 and 6 — validate-workflow-actions, three-workflow sign-off

### Fixed

- CI: Lighthouse CI uses 3 runs with median assertion to reduce shared-runner flake while keeping 0.9 performance budget
- Security Scan: pin `aquasecurity/trivy-action` to SHA `a9c7b0f` (v0.36.0); invalid `@0.28.0` ref caused workflow setup failure
- Automation: `scripts/validate-workflow-actions.sh` and `scripts/check-github-ci.sh` (+ `.ps1`) to catch bad action refs and poll required GH workflows before sign-off
- CI: Web TS null narrowing in main.ts, MIT license on web package, scoped Android FOSS grep to Gradle files
- Python: ruff format on greet.py
- Index/pre-commit: CONTRIBUTING.md in TEMPLATE_INDEX; encoding hook covers .ts/.tsx/.toml
- License script: --excludePrivatePackages for private stub packages
- Encoding: normalize UTF-16 index.html and style.css; extend encoding scan to .html/.css

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- `scripts/check-file-encoding.sh` — UTF-8 enforcement in CI and pre-commit
- `.env.example` — documented environment variable stub
- `examples/web/package-lock.json` and `examples/python/uv.lock` — reproducible locked installs
- Build Verification Gate in `INITIALIZATION_PROMPT.md` Section 7 (Sprint 0 + release)
- `PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` entries: bootstrap verification, security triage, SBOM audit, build verification
- Secret rotation procedure in `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
- Android operations checklist in `modules/android/MODULE.md`
- Release workflow `workflow_dispatch` for maintainer dry-run
- Web Vitest coverage budget (90%) matching Python example

### Changed

- Normalized ~46 UTF-16 corrupted files to UTF-8
- `scripts/validate-bootstrap.sh` — encoding, index, lockfile, and LICENSE checks
- `scripts/check-license-compliance.sh` — strict fail on disallowed licenses; stack-scoped CI steps
- `TEMPLATE_INDEX.json` — added LICENSE, scripts, dependency-review, destructive-ops, `.env.example`; version 0.2.0
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` — `@[PROJECT_OWNER]` placeholder; init scripts replace during Sprint 0
- `docs/SECURITY_TRIAGE.md` — private vulnerability reporting in setup
- `docs/UPGRADING_FROM_TEMPLATE.md` — cherry-pick rows for new scripts/workflows
- `BUILD_PLAN.md` — encoding, lockfiles, Build Verification Gate in Sprint 0 and Milestone Gates
- `README.md` — links THREAT_MODEL, PRIVACY, RUNBOOK, THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES, LICENSE
- CI: license check after locked installs; `uv sync --locked`; encoding-check job first
- `docs/MAINTAINING_THE_TEMPLATE.md` — release dry-run steps
- Init scripts — CODEOWNERS replacement, GITHUB_ABOUT.md draft, update checker config

### Human-only (not automated)

- Enable Dependabot alerts + private vulnerability reporting on GitHub
- Branch protection on `main` with required CI checks (`encoding-check`, `validate-bootstrap`)
- Replace `@[PROJECT_OWNER]` in CODEOWNERS with real GitHub username
- Paste GitHub About description from `docs/GITHUB_ABOUT.md`

- Ecosystem module guides: Android, Web, Python, Lightroom
- CI/CD guardrails: matrix CI, CodeQL, Trivy, Dependabot, release workflow
