# Build Plan

> Prioritized task board with owner labels, Sequential and Parallel lanes per sprint.
> Move completed items to `COMPLETED_TASKS.md`.

## Owner Label Legend

| Label | Owner | When to use |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `AGENT` | Cursor Agent | Code, docs, scaffolding, tests, CI config |
| `HUMAN` | Human developer | Approvals, credentials, GitHub settings, product decisions |
| `ADB` | Human (Android) | Android SDK, emulator/device testing, F-Droid submission |
| `AUTO` | CI/scripts/bots | GitHub Actions, Dependabot, pre-commit, update checker |

**Task format:** `- [ ] [OWNER] Description`

**Filter by label:**

```bash
grep '\[AGENT\]' BUILD_PLAN.md
grep '\[HUMAN\]' BUILD_PLAN.md
```

**Agent rule:** Execute all `[AGENT]` Sequential items first, then dispatch Parallel agents with isolated file scopes.
